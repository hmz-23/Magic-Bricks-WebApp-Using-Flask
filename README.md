# Magic Bricks WebApp Using Flask
The Data has been extracted from MagicBricks (a website, provides common platform to property buyer and seller).\
Dataset consists of 12 columns and 1259 rows. 
6 of the features are numerical valued and rest are categorical.

## Technologies Used :
#### Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/neelkamal692/delhi-house-price-prediction
#### Flask : Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

I have used basic HTML & Python for the development of this project.
